== Description ==

This plugin puts blogging suggestions on your Add New Post page based on five RSS feeds that you can configure. Useful for those of us who run out of things to blog about. The plugin comes with five default feeds (BBC news, WordPress and Harleyquine.com included) and the feeds are configurable from the settings page Settings > Write About Me. The plugin has been tested in WordPress 2.7.1 but there’s no reason why it wouldn’t work in slightly older installations.

== Installation ==

1. Install using WordPress 2.7.1
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Modify the feeds in Settings > Write About Me

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What sort of feeds can I use? =

Just about anything. The plugin uses WordPress functions to parse to feeds so anything WordPress can handle i.e RSS and ATOM.. this script can handle. Could be your friends blogs, a feed from an online aggregator, news/music/entertainment feeds. The list is endless.
